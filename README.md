# Online_Fraud_Detection
I developed a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions using a Kaggle dataset. Leveraging pandas, numpy, and plotly.express for data analysis, I identified key features. Using sklearn, I built and fine-tuned a DecisionTreeClassifier. The model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its potential for real-world fraud detection.
